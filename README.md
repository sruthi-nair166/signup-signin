### Overview

This project is a responsive Signup and Signin page with client-side JavaScript validations. It allows users to create an account by entering their details and validates each field with inline error messages for better user feedback.

The Signup page includes validations for full name, email format, phone number, city name, password strength, and password confirmation. User credentials are stored using browser localStorage.

The Signin page verifies the entered credentials against the stored data and redirects the user to the Tourist Landing Page upon successful authentication. Invalid credentials display appropriate error messages to guide the user.

The project is designed to be responsive across screen sizes and includes basic accessibility considerations for form inputs and error messages.
